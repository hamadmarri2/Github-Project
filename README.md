## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to provide a practical introduction to **Git**, a powerful version control system, and **GitHub**, a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories. It is designed to help beginners understand the core concepts and workflows of Git and GitHub, including:

- Tracking changes in project files efficiently.
- Collaborating with team members through branches, pull requests, and merges.
- Managing repositories for version control and project organization.
- Learning how to use essential Git commands, such as `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and `git pull`.
- Understanding the integration of Git with GitHub for remote collaboration.

This project equips learners with the skills needed to use Git and GitHub confidently in their software development or collaboration workflows. Whether you are contributing to an open-source project or managing your own codebase, this project serves as the foundation for effective version control practices.
